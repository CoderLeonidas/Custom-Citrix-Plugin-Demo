/*

Capability Blocks and Lists
---------------------------

Each capability block is self contained and contains enough data to completely
describe the setup of the capability. Capabilities are passed between host
and client in capability lists.

CapabilityList:

c1 - More data indicator ( set if data is broken into multiple packets )
c2 - capability block count (0-255)
c3 - Offset to first capability block (low byte)
c4 - Offset to first capability block (high byte)
cn - list of capability blocks


Capability Block:

c1 - capability signature (low byte)
c2 - capability signature (high byte)
c3 - byte count
cn - variable length capability data (0 - 255 bytes)


Hosts Statement of capabilities
-------------------------------

The host will send over a statement of capabilities tagged onto the end of the
INIT_REQUEST packet. This will be in the form of capability list:

If the capability data is greater than 255 bytes then the capability should
be broken into two capabilities.

. The host will initialise and send only those capabilities it can offer.

. The client will look for only those capabilities it is interested in,
  ignoring those it does not recognise.


Module Negotiation of capabilities
----------------------------------

The module C2H/H2C method of negotiation has been extended to support
capability blocks. These capability blocks
will be added to the end of the INIT_RESPONSE and INIT_CONNECT packets as
capability lists.

For each module:

1. The client, using capability information sent from the host, will put together
a list of capabilities it requests. These are sent as a capability list at
the end of the C2H structure.

2. The host will process capability blocks as follows:
· If it does not recognise the signature it will ignore it.
· If it recognises the signature but does not want to support the client
  it will ignore the capability.
· If it recognises the signature and wants to support the capability it
  will make any minor adjustments to the details of the block and add it to
  the list of agreed capabilities. These are sent back as a capability list
  at the end of the H2C structure.

3. The client will read the agreed contract and process them as required.



Parallel development of capabilities
------------------------------------

The process of capability development can then be done in two stages:
1. Claim a signature supplying a name and a description, this is done by
   adding an entry in the signatures section of IcaCaps.h.
   No details of the data structure is needed at this point but it will inform
   other groups that there is work in progress.

2. Submit the Capability block structure once the work is completed.

Only those hosts/clients which have been programmed to understand the new
capability will use it. All others will ignore the unknown signature.

Below is explanation of all the fields in the above structure
===============================================================
Version
Specifies the version number of this capability struture.

OperatingMode
Specifies whether the zone is currently operating under Standard or Daylight time.
  - TIME_ZONE_MODE_STANDARD means the system is currently operating in Standard mode
  - TIME_ZONE_MODE_DAYLIGHT means the system is currently operating in Daylight mode

Bias
Specifies the current bias, in minutes, for local time translation on this
computer. The bias is the difference, in minutes, between Coordinated Universal
Time (UTC) and local time. All translations between UTC and local time are
based on the following formula:

UTC = local time + bias

This member is required.

oStandardName
This is the offset to the null terminated string that contains the name of the
time zone in standard mode. This string can be empty.

StandardDate
Specifies a _DateTime structure that contains a date and local time when the
transition from daylight time to standard time occurs on this operating system.
If this date is not specified, the wMonth member in the structure must be zero.
If this date is specified, the DaylightDate value in the CAP_PACKET_TIME_ZONE
structure must also be specified. This member supports two date formats.
Absolute format specifies an exact date and time when standard time begins.
In this form, the wYear, wMonth, wDay, wHour, wMinute, wSecond, and wMilliseconds
members of the _DateTime structure are used to specify an exact date.

Day-in-month format is specified by setting the wYear member to zero, setting
the wDayOfWeek member to an appropriate weekday, and using a wDay value in the
range 1 through 5 to select the correct day in the month. Using this notation,
the first Sunday in April can be specified, as can the last Thursday in October
(5 is equal to "the last").

StandardBias
Specifies a bias value to be used during local time translations that occur
during standard time. This member is ignored if a value for the StandardDate
member is not supplied. This value is added to the value of the Bias member
to form the bias used during standard time. In most time zones, the value
of this member is zero.

oDaylightName
This is the offset to the null terminated string that contains the name of the
time zone in daylight mode. This string can be empty.

DaylightDate
Specifies a _DateTime structure that contains a date and local time when
the transition from standard time to daylight time occurs on this operating
system. If this date is not specified, the wMonth member in the _DateTime
structure must be zero. If this date is specified, the TimeZoneStandardDate value in
the CAP_PACKET_TIME_ZONE structure must also be specified. This member supports
the absolute and day-in-month time formats described for the StandardDate member.

DaylightBias
Specifies a bias value to be used during local time translations that occur
during daylight time. This member is ignored if a value for the TimeZoneDaylightDate
member is not supplied. This value is added to the value of the Bias member
to form the bias used during daylight time. In most time zones, the value
of this member is -60.

EncodingType
The encoding type for the strings that are sent through this capability packet.
It is 0 for ANSI/ASCII and 1 for UNICODE. Currently, the Standard name and the
Daylight Name are the only strings that are sent.

EncodingData
If the encoding type for the strings that are sent in this packet is ASCII
then the code page of the system should be set in this field.

 Below is an explanation of all the fields in the above structure.
 Version. Specifies the version number of this capability structure.
 OperatingMode. Specifies whether the zone is currently operating under standard or daylight savings time.
 TIME_ZONE_MODE_STANDARD means the system is currently operating in standard mode.
 TIME_ZONE_MODE_DAYLIGHT means the system is currently operating in daylight savings mode.

 This member is required.
 oStandardName. This is the offset to the null-terminated string that contains the name of the time zone in standard mode. This string can be empty.
 StandardDate. Specifies a _DateTime structure that contains a date and local time when the transition from daylight savings time to standard time occurs on this operating system. If this date is not specified, the wMonth member in the structure must be zero. If this date is specified, the DaylightDate value in the CAP_DYNAMIC_TIME_ZONE_INFO structure must also be specified. This member supports two date formats. Absolute format specifies an exact date and time when standard time begins. In this form, the wYear, wMonth, wDay, wHour, wMinute, wSecond, and wMilliseconds members of the _DateTime structure are used to specify an exact date.

If this date is not specified, the wMonth member in the _DateTime structure must be zero. If this date is specified, the StandardDate value in the CAP_DYNAMIC_TIME_ZONE_INFO structure must also be specified. This member supports the absolute and day-in-month time formats described for the StandardDate member.

This member is ignored if a value for the TimeZoneDaylightDate member is not supplied. This value is added to the value of the Bias member to form the bias used during daylight savings time. In most time zones, the value of this member is Ð60.
 TimeZoneNameType: Client sets this member to indicate the type of time zone name saved in TimeZoneName. It is 1 for Windows time zone key name and 2 for IETF time zone name. Server sets this member to indicate the time zone name types that are supported on server and the value is a combination of the supported time zone name type flags. For example, if server supports both Windows time zone key name and IETF time zone name, server needs to set this member to 3. Currently, only Windows time zone key name is implemented and supported by server.
 
 #define TIME_ZONE_KEY_NAME	1	Windows time zone key name
 #define IETF_TIME_ZONE_NAME	2	IETF time zone name
 
 oTimeZoneName. This is the offset to the null terminated string that contains the time zone name.
 DynamicDaylightTimeDisabled. Specifies whether dynamic daylight saving time is disabled. Setting this member to TRUE disables dynamic daylight saving time, causing the system to use a fixed set of transition dates.
 EncodingType. The encoding type for the strings that are sent through this capability packet. It is zero for UTF-8 and one for UTF-16. Currently, the StandardName, the DaylightName and the TimeZoneName are the only strings that are sent.
